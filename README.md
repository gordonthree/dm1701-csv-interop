# VHF and UHF frequencies from the National Interoperability Field Operations Guide
Most of these frequencies require a license and permission from a public safety organization to use during an active incident. Read the NIFOG for full information.


## Doesn't include the 700-800mhz freqs, or any P25 digital channels
Mostly copy-pasta from the guide, tried to preserve CTCSS codes where indicated in the guide.

The CSV also includes the FRS/GMRS, MURS, NWR and the CMEN MI-5 statewide DMR network (amateur radio)

## Programming info:
This CSV is for the OpenGD77 firmware, but should be easy to adopt to other radios, or imported into Chirp for example.
